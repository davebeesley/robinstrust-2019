Leo Hoenig is a "probably" retired control engineer, currently running a hotel in France. Whilst Leo isn't currently a Cheltenham resident, distance is no real obstacle thanks to the Trusts use of Slack and Skype.

Apart from Cheltenham Town, Leo is a committed groundhopper who watches football at all levels, and has watched the game at over 4,000 grounds in more than 80 different countries
