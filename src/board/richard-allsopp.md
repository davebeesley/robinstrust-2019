I’ve been a member of the Trust board since 2017 and been volunteering for the Trust since 2014. My main role for the Trust is to organise and promote the 1 to 100 Half-Time Raffle Draw. On matchdays you will see me in bar areas and out in the main Car Park (in all weathers!), hoping to persuade you to purchase a raffle ticket (or 5!). I enjoy this role, as it allows me to engage with our diverse fanbase throughout the season and also helps promotes the Trust in a way that supporters can easily participate.

Away from the Trust, I work as an English & Maths Tutor, delivering 1 to 1 sessions to young people, focusing on those who aren’t able to access mainstream education providers, for a wide variety of reasons. My personal achievement that I’m most proud of is achieving an Honours Degree in IT/Multimedia from the University of Gloucestershire. In my spare time, I enjoying socialising with family and friends: cinema, concerts, eating out, festivals & shows.

I look forward to meeting all existing (and new!) supporters throughout the coming season. Please feel free to stop & chat to me about the role of the Trust within CTFC and how you can volunteer if you have some free time.

COYR!!
