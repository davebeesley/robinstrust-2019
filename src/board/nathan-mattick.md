Nathan is the first wheelchair user to quality as a football referee in the UK. He is a regular volunteer at the club on match days. Heâ€™s been part of the board since 2016.

When Nathan is not involved with CTFC, he is a Co-Trainer for Building Circles, where we go into schools to talk to children about disability and anti-bullying.
