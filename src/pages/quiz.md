## Robins Trust Quiz

_Saturday, May 2, 3pm_

Saturday afternoon at 3pm is a time when we should all be together with our friends watching the team we love.

The current lockdown prevents us from being able to be at Whaddon Road cheering on the Robins, but it doesn’t stop us trying to get together in the virtual world.

Resident Cheltenham Town statto Mark Halliwell has offered his services as quizmaster to the Robins Trust with the aim of getting Cheltenham Town fans together at 3pm on Saturday.

From May 2, we are hoping to host a regular Robins Trust Quiz via the video conferencing app Zoom.

Not only will it be a chance to test your mind and memory, it will be a chance to get together with friends from the terraces.

This Saturday (May 2) entry will be free of charge.

Once we have established that the idea – and the technology works – we want to use the Quiz to raise money for a community charity.

We can discuss who and what charity that will be during the first run on Saturday.

Trust chair James Young and Mark Halliwell will be the quizmasters, asking the questions and marking your answers.

The prize on offer will be the knowledge that you are the Brain of CTFC, for a week at least.

You will need a laptop or device that is capable of connecting to the internet and the app Zoom (www.zoom.us) and a working e-mail address to submit your answers to.

To register your interest, and to ensure you get the information sent about how to enter and join the Zoom room, [enter here]([mailto:quizmaster@robinstrust.org](https://bit.ly/May2Quiz))

On the day, answer sheets will need to be submitted to [quizmaster@robinstrust.org](mailto:quizmaster@robinstrust.org)

Registrations will close at around 2pm on Saturday afternoon – and the invitation will be sent at around 2.45pm, so we can all have a pre-match chat.

See you on Saturday.
