**The Robins Trust was founded in 2005 following an open meeting of Cheltenham Town supporters.**

In the immediate aftermath of the ITV Digital collapse, Football League clubs were experiencing critical money worries, and fan ownership through a supporters trust was becoming common.

At Cheltenham Town there has, thankfully, never been a crippling concern over the club’s future, so the Robins Trust was set to be an aid to the club, not its saviour.

In the first 10 years since foundation in July 2005, the Trust steadily increased its shareholding and membership, and supported the club whenever funds allowed.

The Trust was on course to, one day, achieve its aim of having a supporter-elected representative sit on the Cheltenham Town board.

The Trust’s aims and objectives changed in 2013 when our founding secretary Bryan Jacob died.

Unbeknown to anyone, Bryan had named the Robins Trust as the sole beneficiary in his will.

The proceeds of his estate amounted to more than £200,000 and led to a historic vote in April 2015.

Trust members agreed to invest £200,000 into Cheltenham Town, thus securing a place on the club board.

Long-term chairman Clive Gowing was duly elected to serve as the club’s first ever Fan Elected Director, completing his two-year term in April 2017.

After Clive’s two-year term as FED ended, he decided to call time on his eight-year tenure as Trust chairman, leaving the Trust to contemplate a new era.

Another open meeting – similar to the one held at inception in 2005 – was held and a new working group was established aimed at relaunching the Trust.

Working alongside Murry Toms, the Trust relaunched in October 2017, with a new plan for a new era.
