The Robins Trust has endeavoured since 2005 to bring together Cheltenham Town FC and it's fan base.

We achieve this through a clear dialog between the Trust Members, our Board and the Board of the Club via our Fan Elected Director.

The Trust's role is that of a _Critical Friend_ to the Club - providing advice, insight and fundraising (via share investment) to the Club when it needs it most
