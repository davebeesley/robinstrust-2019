  <span class="s1">Dear Robins fan,</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It is difficult to know where to start – given that so much has happened with the Robins Trust in the past two weeks.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">First, and most importantly, I would like to thank everyone who attended the SGM last week, and also to those who voted by proxy ahead of the meeting.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The meeting was full of fans making  their passionate opinion heard, and I am sure that this would have made Bryan incredibaly proud.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The votes saw the Trust membership agree to invest £200,000 from Bryan’s legacy into the Football Club immediately and then I was honoured to be elected to be the Trust’s first fan-elected director.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">

</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">To win your trust as the first ever fan elected director is both an honour and a privilege, and I will say to all supporters now, that I will work tirelessly to make sure fans’ views are represented at board level.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">On Monday of this week, I attended my first board meeting, and also the shareholder’s information meeting.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There is not too much to report on at this early stage, although I was able to take a full part in a discussion about season ticket prices for next season.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">By the time you read these notes, that should have been announced, and existing season ticket holders should have received a letter through the post.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As part of my remit as the fan-elected director, I want to ensure that any fan can speak to me and make their feelings known.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We all have a burning passion for the club, and I want to try and ensure that all fans have an opportunity to have their ideas or concerns heard and acted upon at board level.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Robins Trust are planning on holding another session of fan focus groups over the summer.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">However, unlike last year, I will commit to publishing the results from these discussions, so that the points raised are actioned upon and the fans who attend can see progress being made.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It is vital that all ideas are at least explored and each point raised is either acted upon or rejected – with full reasons given for the decision. Fans want accountability and the Trust wants to give them it.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Although the position the club finds itself in at the moment is a perilous one, I believe there is still plenty to look forward to for next season.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Whatever happens, The Trust and I will approach the new season with fresh energy and hope.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We want to build from the opportunity that Bryan Jacob’s magnificent gesture has given us in improving the interaction between the supporters, club board, management and players of Cheltenham Town.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Here’s to making the 2015/16 season – and the coming years – some of the best that the Robins have ever had.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Yours faithfully,</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Clive Gowing</span>
