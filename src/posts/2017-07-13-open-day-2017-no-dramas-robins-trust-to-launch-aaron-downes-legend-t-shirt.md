**He was the first player to sign up to Gary Johnson’s Robins revolution and led us to National League title glory – now Aaron Downes is to star on a T-shirt.**

Cheltenham’s number one Aussie has been a massive fan favourite during his time with the Robins due to his fine on-field performance and, perhaps more tellingly, his leadership and character off it.

In the famous green and gold colours of Australia, the shirt shows Downesy with the National League trophy with the man himself explaining the reason behind the “No dramas” slogan.

“I suppose it’s a fairly typical Aussie phrase and it’s certainly one I say a lot,” Downes said.

“Unlike a lot of what Harry Pell says, it makes perfect sense!”

“I am honoured that the Trust have chosen to do this. It’s a massive thing for me that the fans think of me in that way.

“I have always appreciated the fans at every club I’ve played for and I am pleased to say they have always seemed to take to me.

“That kind of relationship with the supporters has always meant more to me than going to the next club for a few extra quid.

“I have always wanted to be that loyal bloke who is appreciated by the fans and I am thrilled that, they’ve chosen me for this shirt.

“That day when we picked up the National League title was one of the best moments of my career. I still get a shiver down my spine when I see the pictures now.

“And now to have the moment captured in the green and gold of Australia is perfect.”

Since inception in 2005 the Trust has produced a number of legend shirts to commemorate the great players and cult heroes to have represented the Robins.

There are plans to release a number of new designs over the course of the next season, but acting chairman Tarran Wilson and the Trust board felt that captain Downes should be the first.

Tarran said: “When we spoke at a Trust meeting we all agreed that Downesy would make the perfect design for the second phase of Trust shirts.

“He was the first man to sign up to the new era, was captain of our National League title winners and has become a massive fan favourite.

“We are hoping to launch new designs throughout the season, honouring special players and special moments, so watch this space.”

The Aaron Downes NO DRAMAS T-shirts cost £14 or £12 for Trust members and will be on sale at the [Robins Trust run Cheltenham Town Open Day on Sunday][1].

There is an initial limited edition run of shirts for sale in a variety of sizes, but the Trust will be taking orders and producing another run to satisfy demand.

The Trust are also running a prize draw for a signed Neil Grayson legend shirt – to be in with a chance of winning it, visit the Trust stand at the Open Day.
