The Robins Trust welcome and support Cheltenham Town Football Club in reiterating it&#8217;s stance on intolerance and any form of discrimination

Please help us and the Club in making the Jonny-Rocks Stadium a friendly, inclusive atmosphere where everybody can feel safe enjoying a game of football.

If you witness abuse of any kind, please contact your nearest steward &#8211; or report it anonymously via your Fan Elected Director, Dave Beesley &#8211; <a href="mailto:fed@robinstrust.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fed@robinstrust.org</a>
