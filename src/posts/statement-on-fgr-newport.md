The Robins Trust would like to put on record their disappointment at the handling of the removal of the 1887RedArmy from Block 7 of the Colin Farmer Stand for the upcoming home fixtures against Forest Green Rovers and Newport County.

Whilst the decision and outline explanation for this decision is understandable based on the original agreement between the 1887RedArmy and the club's safety officials - we believe a lack of flexibility has been shown in this decision based upon the success of the Singing Section and it's acknowledged contribution to the on pitch success this season.

Likewise, we believe the use of footage of the Singing Section in promotion of the FGR fixture, despite the known removal of them from their usual space in Block 7, is insulting to their contribution this season. Fans Groups are not convenient marketing tools one minute, and inconvenient security issues the next.

We would encourage Cheltenham Town FC to review their decision to move the 1887RedArmy in these instances. And also encourage more flexibility and proactive engagement on these decisions in future
