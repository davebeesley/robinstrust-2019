**Think you know football?**

Are you the biggest sporting brain in Gloucestershire?

Do you know Cheltenham Town better than the rest?

Then the Robins Trust is challenging you to put it to the test in our Question of Sport Quiz Night &#8211; and you don&#8217;t need a coaching badge to enter!

This will be no normal general knowledge quiz, this will be a test about sport, football and most importantly the Robins.

The Robins Trust Question of Sport will take place on Monday, April 23 (7.30pm) at the LCI Rail Stadium.

Entry costs Â£10 per team per team of four, with a cash prize on offer to the winners, along with other spot prizes on the night.

Each team will be joined, on the night, by a special guest.

The matchday menu of food will be on offer throughout the evening as well as a full pay bar.
