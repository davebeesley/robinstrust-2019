**A referee was the centre of attention at Whaddon Road and – for once – a group of Cheltenham Town fans loved every minute.**

Former Premier League official Chris Foy was the Robins Trust&#8217;s guest for an interactive evening explaining the difficult role of the man with the whistle.

Foy is now the head of communications for PGMOL, the organisation that employs 50+ professional match officials.

And along with Select Group 2 referee Simon Hooper, he gave a fascinating insight into to recent rule changes and the tough decisions match officials have to make.

Fans were put on the spot and asked what the difference is between handball and not, as well as judging what is and isn&#8217;t holding in the penalty area.<figure id="attachment_446" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

Robins Trust board member Tarran Wilson, who organised the event said: &#8220;Chris and Simon gave a terrific insight into the difficult life of a referee.

&#8220;We hope the fans that were there appreciated the chance to see what the man in the middle does and why decisions are made.

&#8220;As the Trust evolves we hope to put on similar events. If any fans have ideas on who they would want to see in the chair then please get in contact.&#8221;

Following an hour-long interactive presentation Foy and Hooper &#8211; who took charge of the recent League One Play Off final &#8211; then answered questions from the fans.

They were joined by Robins Trust member Nathan Mattick, the country&#8217;s first qualified powerball referee.

Murry Toms, the Trust&#8217;s Fan Elected Director added: &#8220;On behalf of the Trust I would like to Chris and Simon for giving up their time to put on a terrific session.

&#8220;Like with the recent Trust open meeting there was a heartening turnout of fans. We hope to put on similar events over the course of next season.

&#8220;The Trust are holding a board meeting on Monday  (June 5) at Whaddon Road where we will be putting together an action plan for what comes next.

&#8220;If you want to play an active part in what the Trust does next then please come along, have your say and be a part of an exciting future.&#8221;

  * The next board meeting will be held in the main bar at Whaddon Road on Monday (June 5) at 7.30pm.
