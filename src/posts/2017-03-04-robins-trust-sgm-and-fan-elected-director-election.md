</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Although it may not seem it but it is almost two years since the Robins Trust members voted to invest £200,000 into Cheltenham Town FC securing the first fan elected director at Cheltenham Town FC.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As per the trust rules the fan elected director position was for an initial two years with annual re-elections thereafter. The Robins Trust are therefore announcing the arrangements for their SGM to be held in April. Current Fan Elected Director Clive Gowing can stand for re-election and has signaled his intention to do so but there is still the opportunity for other Robins Trust members to also run for election.</span>
