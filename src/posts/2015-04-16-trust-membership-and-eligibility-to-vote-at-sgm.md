<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Robins Trust is looking forward to welcoming members both new and old to the Special General Meeting at Whaddon Road on Thursday night.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Since announcing the news that Bryan Jacob had left his estate to the Trust, we have been delighted to have received a considerable upsurge in our membership numbers.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At present the Trust has a bigger-than-ever membership database and hope to be able to grow that number even further if we can finally secure our aim of having a Fan Elected Director.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As the Trust is a legally-registered Industrial and Provident Society,  the process of running the elections on Thursday evening are subject to strict conditions as laid out in the society’s rules.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At the start of the election process there was a cut-off date for new members to sign up for the Trust in order to be eligible to participate in the elections.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That cut-off date was on April 2, 2015 (Two weeks prior to the SGM) and only members signed up to the Trust before that date will be able to vote.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Trust board and Election Management Group would like to apologise to any supporters who signed up after this date specifically to vote in these elections.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was an honest mistake made by hard-working volunteers, who in 10 years running the Trust have made it their business never to turn down new members.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If any member who signed up after April 2 would like to have their membership subscription refunded, then please contact <a href="mailto:election@robinstrust.org"><span class="s2">election@robinstrust.org</span></a> and we will arrange this.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">However, the events of Thursday night are only the start of what could be some crucial decisions made by Robins Trust members in the coming weeks, months and years.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As a Trust member, after the events of Thursday night, you could have a Director of Cheltenham Town directly answerable to you.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As Thursday night’s meeting has to run to a strict order of business, it is imperative that the meeting starts on time at 7pm.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Any Cheltenham Town fans are welcome to attend, but only Trust members registered before April 2 will be able to speak and vote during the order of business.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Trust members will be asked to report to the desk by the front doors to register their attendance and receive their agenda and ballot paper.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Representation will be made by both the Trust and from Paul Baker on behalf of Cheltenham Town FC, and there will be a chance to ask questions  before the three votes take place.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">On the conclusion of the meeting, Paul Baker and first-team manager Gary Johnson will be holding a fans forum for all supporters.</span>
