APPALLED by the shocking vandalism suffered by Goals Beyond Grass, the Robins Trust is aiming to unite Gloucestershire’s sports clubs and meet the £12,000 repair bill.

A little over a week ago, vandals broke into the storeroom used by Goals Beyond Grass and trashed six specialist wheelchairs used by the county’s Powerchair Football team.

The specialist chairs are not only used by the charity, but for doing outstanding community work in schools, retirement homes and learning disability centres across Gloucestershire.

So, at the last monthly meeting of the Robins Trust board, it was unanimously agreed that the Trust would kick-start a fundraising bid to meet the repair bill in full.

The Robins Trust’s Fan Elected Director Dave Beesley explained: “As a board we were all absolutely appalled by the vandalism.

“One of our former Board members is closely involved with Goals Beyond Grass and we know it’s a charity that does fantastic work across Gloucestershire.

“We immediately decided that we wanted to help and are now calling on all the professional sports clubs in the county to help us match the expected £12,000 repair bill.”

Working alongside former FED Murry Toms, the Trust have initiated a Crowdfunding Campaign.

They have also put in the first £500 donation and are calling upon Gloucestershire sport to unite and follow suit.

“The Trust is going to kick-start that with £500 and we would love all of Gloucestershire’s professional sports clubs to follow our lead,” Beesley added.

“Normally all the money we make through fund-raising is invested in Cheltenham Town shares, but we all passionately felt that we should help the Gloucestershire community.

“We hope that Cheltenham Town, Forest Green Rovers, Gloucester Rugby and Gloucestershire Cricket will at least match our donation and hopefully give more to this wonderful charity.

“Gloucestershire has some wonderful sports clubs, who do a great deal for the community and we would love to see ‘Gloucestershire United’ to help Goals Beyond Grass.”
