The Robins Trust will relaunch with a new look and new ambitions next week.**

Since the Trust was established in 2005, great successes have been achieved.

More than £250,000 has been invested in Cheltenham Town Football Club, securing Robins fans an elected representative on the club’s board of directors.

Much of this success can be credited to the hard work of a long-standing Trust board, and especially down to the efforts of outgoing Trust chairman Clive Gowing.

With Clive standing down as Chairman and Fan Elected Director, and with the election of Murry Toms as FED, the Trust felt it was time for a fresh new look.

Murry explained: “Since I was elected to serve as FED in April, the Trust has been preparing for a relaunch, aimed at making the next step.

“A decade ago, the idea of having a Fan Elected Director was something of a pipe dream – that all changed when the Trust received the fantastic legacy from our founding secretary Bryan Jacob.

“The role and responsibilities of the Trust changed when we achieved our long-held aim of securing a Fan Elected Director, and now the Trust must change to follow suit.

“At our AGM on October 12, we will outline some exciting changes the Trust will be making with the aim of achieving some ambitious new goals.

“We will be electing a new Trust board and proposing a change to our membership subscriptions that we believe will make the Trust become more representative, and more open than ever before.

“What has been achieved by the hard-working board since inception back in 2005 has been nothing short of remarkable.

“Our aim, now, is to build on that outstanding base and make the Robins Trust better than ever.”

Manager Gary Johnson and Chairman Paul Baker will be joining us for a Q&A afterwards, which will kick-off at 7.45pm.

The evening is open to all supporters of Cheltenham Town, although existing Trust members ONLY are able to vote on each of the items on the agenda.

With only two members of the existing Board standing for re-election, an election to fill the remaining places on the board will be held, with nominations open to all Trust members.

Any existing Trust member willing to stand for election to the Trust Board, must inform the acting chairman by Thursday, September 28 (5pm).

In the event that there are more nominees than available places on the Board (16), details will be published of an election prior to the AGM.

  * **The AGM will be held on Thursday, October 12 (7pm) at Cheltenham Town Football Club (main bar).**
