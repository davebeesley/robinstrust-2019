  <span class="s1"><i>In response to recent emailed questions to the Robins Trust and comments made on social media the Robins Trust will like to issue the following statement ahead of Thursday&#8217;s SGM.</i></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Why is this decision being made now? Is it being rushed?</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Robins Trust board learned of Bryan Jacob’s death in September 2013 and has known that they were the sole beneficiaries of his estate since then.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the nearly two years since, the Trust board has worked hard to ensure that the organisation was ready to receive the final sums upon execution of the will.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Trust members were told of the news in November 2014, once we were in a position to know approximate figures that would be received.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Trust then received the full amount of £222,015.88 into its bank account in March and it was felt that the members should be able to decide on what should happen next at the earliest opportunity.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At no point did the Football Club’s league position or latest set of financial figures factor in that equation – the decision-making process started nearly 18 months before the SGM.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">However, the Trust has maintained an open and constructive dialogue with the Football Club and in particular Paul Baker since learning of Bryan¹s death and gesture in 2013.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At every point the Trust board has reiterated to the Club that they should not expect to receive this money, or budget for it as it was up the Trust¹s membership to decide what happened next.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Like the Trust board, the Football Club did not know the exact figures until the start of March 2015.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">

</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Should the Robins Trust wait until it is know what division the club will be playing in before making a decision on the investments?</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The process has always made without the current league position in mind. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The investment, through Bryan’s legacy, is one which the Trust believe should carry a Fan Elected Director, this has been the aim of the Trust in the 10 years since it was formed. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Regardless of the league the club are playing in the role of the Trust will not change.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The hard work completed by 14 different board members and 500 individual members over the last 10 years has been towards ensuring a Fan Elected Director.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>What does a no vote mean to item one on the SGM agenda, would the Trust then keep all of the money?</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If a no vote is completed the money would remain in the Trust’s account.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Robins Trust board made a rule change at the most recent AGM in November to ensure that any investment greater than £20k required a vote by our members at either an SGM or AGM. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If the vote was a no, Trust board would then try to work on new proposals and speak with the Football Club and the Trust’s membership to try and work out a deal that all parties are happy with.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Trust would then look to stage a further SGM at the earliest opportunity in order to make progress towards its aim of having a Fan Elected Director.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Again, the Trust would like to reiterate that the stance has always been to tell the Football Club not to expect the money, or to budget for it.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>What does a vote for Proposal C on option two of the agenda do in terms of having a Fan Elected Director?</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When the notice of the meeting went out to Trust members last week (7 days before the meeting) negotiations were still ongoing as to what that would mean.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Trust has since received written confirmation from the Football Club that votes for Proposal A and Proposal B WILL lead to a Fan Elected Director.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">However, the Football Club have stated that a vote for Proposal C would mean there IS NOT a Fan Elected Director.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Although the £100,000 threshold was spoken about openly in the past, the Club say it has never been formally approved by the board.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Trust has campaigned in the strongest possible way in the last few weeks for this to change – but at the time of writing a vote for Proposal C WILL NOT result in a fan elected director.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Trust are however still in constant negotiations regarding proposal C and the possibility of whether this would ensure a Fan Elected Director. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">However, the Trust believe that negotiations will not be completed until after the SGM on this point.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If the members vote in reference to proposal C then the Trust will complete a £50k share purchase and continue to campaign for the Fan Elected Director.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The election WILL carry on as planned if Proposal C is selected – in order to have a FED-elect in case the club’s stance changes.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Have the Trust reviewed the Club’s latest set of accounts?</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As a shareholder the Trust received the accounts as normal and have looked at them and noted a number of questions that will be raised at the Shareholders meeting on April 20.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The statement about the going concern in the latest accounts, although alarming, appears in the accounts every year and is typical for a lower League football club.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the past year the Club and Trust have discussed uses for any large investment and have received assurances that it will NOT be used to pay any loans to directors.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Once again, the Trust board reiterates that at no stage have the Club been told to expect the money or to budget for it.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Trust is also aware of other new significant revenue streams that the club are looking into for the short-to-medium term that are not football dependent, or related to share purchases.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">While the Trust has not completed due diligence on the club, the Trust has had constant dialogue with Paul Baker and the board regarding the accounts.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This dialogue has increased in the last 12 months since the Trust learned the full extent of Bryan¹s legacy.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>What would the Trust’s role be on the three sub-committees?</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As well as having a fan elected member on the club board, the agreement in place over positive votes for Proposal A and Proposal B would mean a place on three sub committees.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There would be a Trust representative on the Finance, Operations and Commercial committees respectively, and will not be limited to the FED.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">These representatives would be made up of Robins Trust Board members but not limited to the current board. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Trust board would welcome members with knowledge in any of these three areas to make themselves known to the Trust Board if they think they can assist. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It is also noting that the offer of a place on these three committees came about after our regular dialogue with the club.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Will the Trust have a say in how the money will be spent?</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If an investment is made to secure a FED then the Trust will be able to influence the club’s spending as any other director would. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Trust would also have a representative on the Finance Committee and would seek to have strong influence on finance decisions.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">However, there would be no strict ring fencing of money.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">By having a Fan Elected Director, the Trust wants to help the club make better decisions and hopefully achieve success.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The only way the Trust Board feels that this is possible is by trying to be part of a solution to problems, rather than create further ones.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The club is under no obligation to sell shares to the Trust, and it should be remembered that the club’s majority shareholdings could change in the coming years.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If that was to happen any new owners / majority shareholders could actively refuse to have Trust involvement at board level – and the fans would have no voice whatsoever.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At present there is no individual majority shareholder in Cheltenham Town FC – a £200,000 investment would make the Trust the fourth largest shareholder in the business.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">All of the three other major shareholders have the club’s best interests at heart and the Trust wants to work WITH them to help the club to future success.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The current chance to increase the Trust’s stake in the club, may not be available again in the future.</span>
