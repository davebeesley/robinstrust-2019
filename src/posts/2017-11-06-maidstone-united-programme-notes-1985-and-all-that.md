**It&#8217;s been another busy week at the Robins Trust, _wrote Dave Jennings in our programme notes for the FA Cup first round match against Maidstone United._**

Firstly we&#8217;re delighted to announce The Kemble Brewery, the popular matchday venue in Fairview Street for Cheltenham fans, as an official Trust partner.

Our members can now not only enjoy the menu in a friendly atmosphere but take advantage of an exclusive 20% discount on all food purchases by showing their membership card.

Food is served Tuesday to Sunday each week and dishes vary from pizzas to Sunday roasts.

For opening times please visit [www.thekemblebrewerycheltenham.co.uk][1] and [follow them on Facebook][2] for news of events and special occasions. We thank everyone at The Kemble for supporting the Trust with this excellent offer!

In other news, we held our first ever ‘Saturday Surgery’ before today&#8217;s match. The new idea has been created to allow supporters a regular opportunity to approach members of the organisation to discuss any Club or Trust related issues that they may have, enabling us to represent them.

You may have seen Acting Chairman Tarran Wilson and new board member Jack O’Neill located in the main bar chatting to fans.

Other members of the Trust, including the Fan Elected Director, will always be dotted around the ground and are always happy to discuss any supporter matters.

Finally you may have also seen that [Robins Trust members will receive ticket priority for November’s historic first Football League Gloucestershire derby][3].

November’s ‘El Glosico’ clash with Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn will see a large travelling contingent of Robins heading to Nailsworth.

With tickets likely to be in high demand, the Trust have, once again, secured ticket priority, ahead of general sale tickets.

Robins Trust members will then have a priority window running between Thursday, November 9 and kick off in the League Two home match with Luton Town on November 11.

If you&#8217;re not already a member, then you have until midnight on Wednesday to join up and ensure second tier priority.

Back to matters on the pitch and today&#8217;s match evokes memories for supporters of a certain vintage of the 2-1 win against today&#8217;s opposition on August 24, 1985.

Madonna was In to the Groove at no.1 in the UK charts, Dirty Den an Angie were pulling pints in the Queen Vic and Everton were the current Champions of English football.

John Murphy&#8217;s men were Champions of the Southern League and had taken their place among the elite of the non-league, taking on the Stones in their first ever National League (Gola League) match.

Whaddon Road was the venue and there was over 1,000 spectators (a rare occurrence in the 80s), winning thanks to goals by midfield maestros Steve Brooks and Brian Hughes.

The victory set us up for a tough but enjoyable first season at that level and we eventually finished 11th in the league – won that season by Enfield.
