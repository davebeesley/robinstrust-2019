All profits from Sunday&#8217;s Robins Trust 50/50 draw will be used to buy presents for children on the Children&#8217;s Ward of Gloucester Royal Hospital.

Members of the CTFC squad and the Robins Trust board visit the ward every Christmas to deliver the presents and spend time with the children and staff on the ward.
