Due to circumstances beyond the control of the Robins Trust board, we have taken the decision to postpone – but not cancel – our Question of Sport quiz night on Monday, April 23.
  
When we first planned the quiz night it was our intention for every team to have a special guest player from the football club.
  
Despite the best efforts of John Finnigan and Ben Mottram at the club, we have been unable to fulfil that promise.
  
Therefore, the difficult decision was made to postpone because the Trust did not want to renege on our original promise to fans.
  
It is absolutely our intention to run the Question of Sport Quiz at a time when we can guarantee a great night for all supporters and fulfil the promise of our original advertisement.
  
In the meantime, keep your eye on the Trust website and social channels for news on this and future events.
