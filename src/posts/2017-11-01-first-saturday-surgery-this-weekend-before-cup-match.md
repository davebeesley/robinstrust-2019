**The Robins Trust will be holding a regular &#8216;Saturday Surgery&#8217; before each home match.**

The new idea has been created to allow supporters  to approach members of the organisation to discuss any Club or Trust related issues that they may have, enabling us to represent them.

There will also be an opportunity to purchase a 50/50 draw ticket and join the Trust, now reduced to just £5 annually following last month&#8217;s AGM.

Our first surgery is this weekend (November 4), ahead of the FA Cup first round match against Maidstone United at Whaddon Road.

You&#8217;ll find Acting Chairman Tarran Wilson and new board member Jack O&#8217;Neill located in the main bar between 1pm and 2.30pm.

Other members of the Trust, including the Fan Elected Director, will be dotted around the ground and will be happy to discuss any supporter matters.

Come and say hello!
