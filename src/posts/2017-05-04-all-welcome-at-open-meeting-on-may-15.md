**A new era for the Robins Trust began last month when Murry Toms became the second Fan Elected Director to take a seat on the Cheltenham Town board.**

Now it’s your chance to take a role in what happens next.

With current Trust chairman Clive Gowing standing down from his post and a number of current Trust board members deciding to do likewise, change is in the air.

So, the Trust board has decided to throw the doors open to all Cheltenham Town fans and are encouraging as many as possible to have a say in what direction they want the Trust to take next.

We are holding a Special General Meeting of the Trust board on <span data-term="goog_1146095712">Monday, May 15</span> (<span data-term="goog_1146095713">7.45pm</span>) at the LCI Rail Stadium – and everyone is welcome to attend.

FED Murry Toms will be there on the night to meet and chat with fans and members of the current Trust board will also be in attendance to explain what is involved in being a board member.

And while there will be Trust business to see to on the night, Murry said that the most important item on the agenda will be to hear from fans who aren’t already involved with the Trust.

He said “The main purpose of the meeting is for the board and supporters to have an informal chat about how the Trust works and how you can get involved in making the Trust, and the Club better.

“So if you have any moans or gripes, ideas or suggestions then we would love to see you.

“But more important than that, if you have a passion for Cheltenham Town then this is your chance to have a very real role in what your Trust and Football Club does next.”

**UPDATED: The meeting of the Robins Trust will take place in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Premier Suite</span> at the LCI Rail Stadium from <span data-term="goog_1146095714">7.45pm</span> on <span data-term="goog_1146095715">Monday, May 15</span>. All welcome.**
