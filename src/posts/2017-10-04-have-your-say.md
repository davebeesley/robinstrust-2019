  <strong><span class="s1">A new look, a new board and a new mission for The Robins Trust will be revealed next week.</span></strong>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The new team of board members will outline a clear new message as well as a fresh new look at the <a href="http://robinstrust.org/full-details-of-next-months-robins-trust-agm-and-relaunch/">Trust&#8217;s AGM</a> on Thursday, October 12 (7pm).</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Following Clive Gowing&#8217;s decision to stand down as Fan Elected Director and the election of Murry Toms as his successor, the Trust has decided to stop and take stock.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A new group of prospective board members has been assembled and they have been speaking to a wide range of people, exploring how the organisation is viewed by everyone at the club. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Trust FED Murry Toms explained: &#8220;Over the past 12 years the Trust&#8217;s role and ambitions have changed. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">&#8220;Following the landmark investment enabled by Bryan Jacob&#8217;s legacy, the Trust&#8217;s long-term ambition to have a Fan Elected Director was achieved and now it is time to refocus.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">&#8216;The new board has decided to channel efforts into making the Trust more representative of the fanbase and the wider community.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">&#8220;Our aim is to significantly increase our numbers and reach at least 1,000 members.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">&#8220;The new board have developed a new plan for the Trust going toward and some significant changes will be outlined at the AGM.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <strong><span class="s1">Play your part in the future</span></strong>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Before the AGM takes place, the new look board are asking all Robins supporters to have their say on a new Trust logo and brand.</span>
</p>

<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">There are three ideas for a new logo to choose from, with the most popular becoming the Trust&#8217;s new brand.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">&#8220;We have been working with a local designer – and Whaddon Road regular – to produce a fresh new look,&#8221; Toms added.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We know there’s a lot more work to be done, but we have assembled a talented and committed group of supporters who each have a role to play in moving the Trust forward.</span>
</p>

<p class="p6">
  <span class="s1">“It has been great for us all to talk to so many people around the club over summer about what they think it means to them, but now’s the time to turn the conversations into action.</span>
</p>

<p class="p6">
  <span class="s1">“At Thursday’s AGM we hope to share some of those ideas, and encourage more people to take part in the process. </span>
</p>

<p class="p6">
  <span class="s1">&#8220;This vote is a small but important step to everyone feeling a sense of ownership of what we&#8217;re doing as fans for the club.&#8221;</span>
