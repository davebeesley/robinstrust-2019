**Open Letter to members of the Robins Trust and supporters of Cheltenham Town FC**

Following discussions with both supporters direct and a number of Cheltenham Town supporters, I want to ensure Robins Trust Members and all supportersÂ of Cheltenham Town FC that they will be engaged regarding the recent Whole Game Solution proposals presented by the Football League.

As a club Cheltenham Town have always been very open with supporters and hold regular fan&#8217;s forums throughout the season. The next proposed forum is to be held around November time with a firm date to be announced in the coming weeks.

I have read through the current proposals and the presentation presented at the football league AGM in July and in my view the current proposals lead to far more questions than answers.

Although these proposals have yet to be fully discussed at a CTFC board meeting, discussions via email or over a pint have taken place both with other CTFC directors and those of other clubs in our division.

Many supporters will have read about the restructure to 5 divisions of 20 teams although how this restructuring will take place and the financial implications to clubs is still widely unknown.

It is expected that more information will be made available from the football league in the coming months with the vote by all member clubs not taking place until the Football League AGM in Summer 2017.

Once more information is circulated by the football league Cheltenham Town FC will look to both share this information with our supporters and engage their views on the proposals ahead of the vote at the Football League AGM.

Regards

Clive Gowing

Fan Elected Director
