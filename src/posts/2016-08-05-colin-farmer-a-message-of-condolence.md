    <span class="s1">The Robins Trust would like to offer their condolences to the friends and family of Colin Farmer following the sad news of Colin passing away earlier this week. Robins Trust chairman Clive Gowing pays tribute to Colin below.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Many tributes and messages have been written this week since the news of Colin passing was announced and I think the most fitting thing is the amount of different people have spoken out to offer their condolences. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Colin was a fantastic servant to Cheltenham Town FC and every supporter should be thankful for the work he put in over his 29 years on the board at CTFC. The transformation of the football club in that time is a truly remarkable achievement and it is fitting that Colin’s last season at the club was the most enjoyable and important season of his 29 years.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">He was a person who didn’t seek the limelight and would just get things done. One of his phrases was “leave it with me” and if he said that you knew that within a couple of weeks the problem would be fixed.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Many of these problems would have been fixed by Colin calling in a favour or two and costing the club nothing apart from maybe a couple of complimentary tickets. The fact he could pull in so many favours over the years proves that he was a man that was truly liked. </span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">Colin was everyone’s friend who had a story for any occasion even if he did tell them more than once! He did however keep it very quiet last season that he had in fact played for Forest Green and it was only in his passing that this was discovered. I am sure he would have taken a good ribbing if that fact had been know during parts of last season!</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="p1">
    <span class="s1">I have known Colin for a long time but it is only really the last year since I joined the board that myself and my family really got to know Colin well. Although that was not long enough the sadness we all feel of his passing is a real testament of his character and the way he can touch you in such a short time.</span>
