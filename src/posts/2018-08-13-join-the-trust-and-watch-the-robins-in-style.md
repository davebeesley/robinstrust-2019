The Robins Trust is offering a lucky member the chance to live the high life at the home game against Colchester on September 1.

Any existing Trust member will join those signing up by August 20 for a chance to win a hospitality package.

The prize worth £60 per person includes a two-course meal, half-time refreshments and access to a dedicated cash bar throughout the afternoon.

The winner will also get a car-park pass, a complimentary match programme and teamsheet while enjoying impeccable service from a matchday host.

All existing Trust members will be automatically entered into the draw, while members who sign up online at <a href="http://robinstrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://robinstrust.org&source=gmail&ust=1534274352201000&usg=AFQjCNGzz2Gucrog50QYf7ZRIRvDUMOuBA">robinstrust.org</a> or via our matchday surgery on Saturday will also be entered.

One lucky winner will win tickets for them and a guest and a car park pass between them.

Trust membership is cheaper than ever before, costing just £5 to be a member for the 2018/19 season.

As well as the chance to win this superb prize, Trust members are eligible for reduced-price entry for Bishop&#8217;s Cleeve home games when the Robins aren&#8217;t playing and free entry to all Cheltenham Town Ladies home matches.
