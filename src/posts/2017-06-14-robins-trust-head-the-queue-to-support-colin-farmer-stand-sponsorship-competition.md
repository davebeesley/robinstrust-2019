On Monday, club commercial manager John Finnigan released details of a £100 per ticket raffle for the right to sponsor the Colin Farmer Stand.

And within minutes, the new-look Robins Trust board swung into action.

They agreed to buy one of the golden tickets and the Trust’s Fan Elected Director Murry Toms immediately got in touch with Finnigan.

The result was that the Trust became the proud owners of ticket number one for the draw that will take place at the Bristol City friendly match on July 25.

Trust FED Murry Toms said: “We were at a Trust meeting on Monday night when Finners released details of the raffle on Twitter.

“Almost immediately, we agreed as a Trust board that we would show our support by buying a ticket.

“We got in touch with Finners and were the first people to sign up for the raffle. Hopefully, lots of others will join us.

“Each and every week it’s us the supporters who are the ones sitting in that stand, so why don’t we try and be the sponsors?”

The networking evening will also provide a chance for the members of a new-look Trust board to meet and speak with individuals and businesses who support the club.

Long-serving Trust board member Leo Hoenig added: “We all agreed that this would be a perfect way for the Trust to show its continued support to the club.

“Since Murry was elected as FED, the Trust has welcomed a number of new members to our board and many of these new members will attend the networking event.

“I’ve been a Trust board member since we started out more than a decade ago and we have achieved a lot of good things in that time.

“But never before have we had as many new and fresh faces, with new and fresh ideas on board. These are exciting times for the Trust.”

Robins commercial manager John Finnigan said: “This is a great way to support the club and have the opportunity to mix with many of our sponsors and supporters.

“I would like to thank The Robins Trust for supporting us, yet again. This was a very successful event last season and we are hoping to emulate that this year.”
