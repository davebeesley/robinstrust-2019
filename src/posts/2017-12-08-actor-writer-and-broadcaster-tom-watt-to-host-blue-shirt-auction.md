**This weekend we&#8217;re helping to turn Cheltenham Town blue to raise awareness for the work done by the British Lung Foundation.**

But we also want to raise a few quid in the process and there are a number of ways that everyone can help the cause.

**Donations**

Firstly there will be a bucket collection in all four corners of the ground at Saturday&#8217;s game.

Members of the Trust, together with youth players and representatives of the charity will be shaking blue buckets from 1.30pm onwards, so please anything you can spare.

There is also a special text-to-donate number. Supporters can text **CTFC17 £3** to **70070** to make donations from their mobiles. We will be putting the number up on the scoreboard during the game, as well as sharing information from the charity.

**Fans Fest, special guests and giveaways**

Before the game, [DJ Shippers will be joined by guest DJs Jordon Forster and Jordan Cranston][1] for a unique event before kick-off. Entry is free but there will be an opportunity to donate any loose change you may be able to spare at the door.

We will be giving away a selection of our legends T-shirts featuring Neil Grayson, Bob Bloomer, Julian Alsop and [Aaron Downes][2] to a handful of lucky punters so join us to help get the day off to a great start in the main bar.

**Auctions – stuff you won&#8217;t get anywhere else!**

After the match we will be auctioning a shirt worn by one of the players in the League Two match against Crewe Alexandra. We need your help to decide which one through a Twitter poll on the day so follow us and keep your eyes peeled during the game.

Actor, writer and broadcaster Tom Watt has very kindly offered his services as our guest auctioneer, getting underway at 5.30pm in the main bar.

He will open the bidding for the fan-chosen blue shirt, a pair of Carabao Cup final (general admission) tickets, an official Mitre Delta EFL match ball signed by the squad plus a signed Neil Grayson legends T-shirt with every penny going to the charity. Everyone is welcome to come and get involved.

Up in the hospitality areas they will be vying for the Man of the Match&#8217;s jersey in an auction of their own. The award is traditionally chosen by the sponsors but in the event that the winner matches that of the poll we will auction the player with the second highest share of the vote.

**Online auctions – coming soon**

The remainder of the squad&#8217;s shirts will soon be auctioned online with our [friends at AMS Auctions][3]. The Leckhampton-based have a wealth of experience both in the UK and overseas markets, but more importantly they are regulars at Whaddon Road and often sponsor matches themselves! They have kindly offered their expertise at no cost to help us raise as much money.

We&#8217;re truly thankful for everyone who has offered to play their part in the event. It has been a monumental team effort. Keep an eye on our Twitter and Facebook pages over the next few days for all the latest updates.

**Come on you blues!**
