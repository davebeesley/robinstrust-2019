**Update on Bryan Jacob Donation**

At the Robins Trust AGM in November the Robins Trust board made a commitment to ensure our members were regularly updated regarding the position of Bryan Jacob’s estate. We have been in touch with the solicitors and the estate accounts have been drafted and are with the executors to sign off. Once this step is completed the accounts will be sent to the Trust Board to agree and sign off before the accounts are finalised and money transferred.

Clive Gowing (Trust Chairman) has met with Paul Baker to discuss some initial proposals on how the money could be put to use and the aim of the Robins Trust of having a representative on the Cheltenham Town board. The next step in this process is for the Trust Board to agree to these proposals and then these will be presented to our members to vote on.

The Robins Trust board will not and can’t authorise any large expenditure without taking these proposals to our members first for their agreement.

This was a new policy which the Robins Trust was keen to introduce at our most recent AGM. Having spoken to Supporters Direct the Robins Trust is one of only a handful of supporter’s trusts to implement such a rule. This is something we were passionate about adopting because we believe that the Robins Trust is about our members and we are all in this together.

**50/50 Draw Sellers**

One of the largest fund raisers for the Robins Trust is the match day 50/50 draw. This is something that the Trust has been running for many years and has always been operated by valued volunteers. If you do feel that you could help out on a match day then please do get in touch, your help will always be gratefully received.
