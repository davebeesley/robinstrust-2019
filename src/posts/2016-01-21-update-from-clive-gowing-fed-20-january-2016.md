<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Happy New Year to you all.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">2015 was a year that provided Cheltenham Town with downs and then ups almost in equal measure – I, for one, wasn’t sure whether I wanted it to end!</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But as we kick-off 2016, I wanted to take some time to tell you the latest things I have been working on as the club’s Fan Elected Director.</span><span class="s1"> </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">

</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Oxford City Prices</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hopefully you will have all seen the announcements regarding the prices for the Oxford City replay.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">These prices were set with the fans in mind to ensure their loyalty and continued support shown over the season to date is rewarded.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The away following shown at Boreham Wood and Oxford were a credit to the club and our home support continues to remain strong.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Special mention should also go to Oxford City in their support of our arrangements.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> </span><span class="s1">I met with their chairman after Saturday’s match, along with other members of the club board and as a club they were incredibly willing to help us. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Hospital Visit</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Prior to Christmas the Robins Trust organised the annual visit to the Children’s Ward at Gloucestershire Royal hospital.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This is an event the Trust have been organising for the past decade and is very rewarding to be able to support.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Without the continued support of Trust members we would not be in a position to organise this and I thank you all for your support.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This year, the feedback received from the hospital was very pleasing and a credit to Aaron Downes and the players who attended and took their time to talk to the children and parents on the ward.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Focus Groups</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Trust and Football Club are looking to host another joint Fans Focus Group in the coming weeks.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The initial date is set for Thursday 11</span><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> February with a 7pm start time. If you would like to be involved in the event then please email <a href="mailto:clive.gowing@robinstrust.org"><span class="s3">clive.gowing@robinstrust.org</span></a></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Supporters Player of the Year Trophy</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Robins Trust recently announced that they will be honouring the fantastic gesture Bryan Jacobs gave to the supporters of Cheltenham Town by renaming the supporters player of the year trophy in Bryan’s honour.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We will  be looking to invite some of Bryan’s close friends to the match as our guests and be the firsts to present what will be a new trophy to this year’s player.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This was considered to be a very fitting way to remember Bryan as it will always provide a lasting memory of his fantastic gesture.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Mascots</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I have also recently offered to help promote the club’s mascot package with the aim of ensuring there is at least one mascot at every Saturday home match between now and the end of the season.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I can speak fist-hand as a father when saying that this is truly an excellent and enjoyable day, </span><span class="s1">which includes a guided tour of the ground and trip into the dressing room to meet the team.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Mascot packages are priced at £70 and include the pre-match photograph with captains and officials plus a signed photo of your favourite player.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Also a free programme, 1 adult and 2 junior match tickets plus the chance to lead out the players before kick off.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A special price of £40 is being offered to all season ticket holders who do not require the match tickets.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Other Items to note</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the past few months I have been involved in a number of different meetings with the clubs media, marketing and ticketing departments.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We are always looking at new and innovative ways to improve what we are offering and, along with two of my Trust colleagues, continue to be involved in the three board sub committees.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I represent the Trust on the finance committee, Mike Collins sits on the commercial committee and Brian Lancaster  is the Trust member on the operations group.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Over the coming weeks and months we will hopefully be able to feedback on the work being done on those three committees by Trust members.</span>
