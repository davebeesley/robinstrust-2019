**It&#8217;s good to be back for the first match of the year, _wrote Murry Toms in our programme notes for the Accrington Stanley match._**

It promises to be a fantastic 12 months, with one eye on the past and the other firmly on the future.

Twenty years ago this May we won at Wembley, the day the town fell in love with the club.

We&#8217;ve had our moments but on the whole the past two decades have been nothing short of remarkable and we will help commemorate that pivotal day in our history at the end of the season.

Then we want to play our part in what comes next and we can all play a part in that.

We&#8217;ve hit the ground running in January after an eventful time at the Robins Trust.

We now have all the new membership cards, certificates and letters sporting our new branding and we&#8217;re keen to get these out to everyone as soon as we can.

We know a handful of supporters have waited some time to receive them but we appreciate their patience and we are working as quickly as we can.

Our membership has more than doubled in the last 12 months so we have a long list to get through but rest assured, it&#8217;s all hands to the pump.

Ideally we&#8217;d like fans to come along and collect them on matchdays to speed up the process, but of course we will arrange postage where necessary.

Simply let us know at info@robinstrust.com and we&#8217;ll arrange that.

Otherwise members can find us in the main bar at Barnet game in a fortnight to grab their new packs, and each home game after that.

We&#8217;re also thrilled to announce the [details of the online auction for the special blue shirts][1].

We were approached by club sponsors AMS Auctions, based up in Leckhampton, to help out on this front and for that we&#8217;re very grateful.

They have a wealth of national and oversees experience in this space and their support has been invaluable.

And the best bit is that they&#8217;re regulars, home and away, so they&#8217;re simply playing their part in the massive team effort.

All the shirts are up for grabs, except for Jamie Grimes&#8217; and Danny Wright&#8217;s which went collectively for £300 in the post-match auctions.

We have also received the jersey which was featured on Sky Sport&#8217;s Soccer AM (or Soccer PM as it was on December 9, on a day of firsts).

Boxer Tyson Fury, Danny Dyer from Eastenders and the rest of team signed it and sent it back to us which is a classy touch.

The auction goes live on Wednesday at midday and will run for 10 days until Saturday, January 27, when it closes at 9pm after the home match against Barnet.

That means everyone has a few days to head over to amsauctions.co.uk to quickly register their details to be ready for the off.

The bidding for each will start at £40, which is the price you&#8217;d pay in the shop for a replica shirt, and bidding will go up in increments of £2 thereafter.

You&#8217;ll find all the details on both our website and ctfc.com, plus all the usual social media channels this weekend.

So far we&#8217;ve raised close to £2,500 so far I&#8217;d love to see us hit the £4,000-mark so get behind a great cause and grab a piece of Robins&#8217; history in the process!
