  <span class="s1">The Robins Trust and Cheltenham Town Football Club will be holding a focus group on Monday 18th May and we want to hear your views.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Like last year, when the Football Club arranged a similar event, we want to hear from as wide a cross-section of Robins fans as possible.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">We want to hear from fans young and old, male or female, season ticket holder or not on the issues that matter to you.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Whether it&#8217;s the way the club engages with fans, what you do on a matchday, or how the club operates, we want to hear from you.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">As the club looks forward to a new era, it&#8217;s vital that the views of the fans are heard &#8211; if you have strong opinions, or ideas of how to make things better, we want to hear from you.</span>
</p>

<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">If you want to be involved e-mail to Robins Trust fan elected director Clive Gowing atÂ <a href="mailto:clive.gowing@robinstrust.org"><span class="s2">clive.gowing@robinstrust.org</span></a> stating your name, age, the number of years you have been supporting the Robins and the area of the ground where you watch the games.</span>
</p>

<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Also, if you feel you have skills that would be of benefit to the Football Club, please note them on your e-mail.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Cheltenham Town is your club, and your views count.</span>
