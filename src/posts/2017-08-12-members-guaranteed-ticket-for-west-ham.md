**Robins Trust members will be guaranteed a ticket for Cheltenham Town’s Carabao Cup tie against West Ham United.**

As has been the case with previous high-demand games, Trust members will benefit from being in the second priority tier, after season ticket holders and club shareholders
  
The Trust’s Fan Elected Director Murry Toms has been involved in discussions regarding the ticketing arrangements and has made strong representations on behalf of Trust members.

Trust acting chairman Tarran Wilson said: “As soon as the draw was made, the Trust board discussed our desire to renew the priority arrangements we have enjoyed in the past.

“Murry immediately made the case to the football club board and we are delighted to say that the arrangement we have had in the past has been renewed.”

As part of the agreement between the Football Club and Trust, there will be a cut-off for new members to receive ticket priority.

All existing Trust members will be automatically receive priority as per the club&#8217;s official announcement on Friday.

Any supporter wishing to become a member and receive priority must be a paid-up member before midnight on Tuesday, August 15.

Supporters were able to sign up for membership before and after Saturday’s game against Crawley Town and can do at Tuesday night’s Checkatrade Trophy game against Swansea City Under-21s.

Trust members will then be able to purchase one ticket per valid membership on Wednesday, August 16 and Thursday, August 17, prior to general sale starting on Friday, August 18.

Fan Elected Director Murry Toms said: “Part of my responsibility as the Trust’s FED is to fight for the rights of our members, so as soon as the tie was drawn I put our case to my fellow board members.

“Ticket priority is one of the Trust’s key selling points and I am pleased that the rest of the board have been open to renewing the arrangements we have enjoyed in the past.

“This priority should mean all Trust members are guaranteed a ticket for one of our biggest home games in years, who knows you could have a ticket for Man United in the next round too!”

Trust members will be entitled to one ticket per membership. Family members will have access to a maximum of two adult tickets and the number of child tickets as prescribed on their membership.
