The Robins Trust welcomes Cheltenham Town Football Club’s response to our call for clarification over the £5 increase to all season tickets after the club announced there was a price freeze.

However, the Robins Trust board criticises the decision to apply the charge to the most loyal supporters and also the lack of apology for the club’s initial misleading announcement.
