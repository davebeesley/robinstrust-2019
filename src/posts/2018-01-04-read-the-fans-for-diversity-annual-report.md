**We&#8217;re pleased to share the third &#8216;Fans for Diversity&#8217; annual report, jointly produced by [Kick It Out][1] and [The Football Supporters&#8217; Federation][2].**

It highlights the great impact the campaign has made by working to bring fans, communities and clubs closer together in both the Football League and the non-league scene.

It&#8217;s primary aim is focused on making the game as inclusive as possible, and key to this success has been giving fans the opportunity to access the [Fans for Diversity Fund][3].

The funding is designed to help and encourage fan-led activity that celebrates equality and diversity in football, and to date it has funded well over 100 events, activities and fan resources.

If you have any ideas of your own, or know of any Cheltenham Town fans you feel would benefit from the fund, please get in touch with us at **info@robinstrust.org**.
