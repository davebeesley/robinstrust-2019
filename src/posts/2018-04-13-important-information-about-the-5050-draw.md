There will be no Robins Trust 50/50 draw taking place during the Forest Green Rovers game on Saturday.

The Trust relies on its hardy band of volunteers to run the 50/50 draw and due to a number of factors, there are not enough volunteers available to service what is expected to be a bumper crowd.

However, the Trust board has decided to run a bumper draw for the home game against Coventry City, with a jackpot prize of £250 to be won.

Each season, the Trust hands out more than £2,000 in prizes through the 50/50 draw, with the other half of the proceeds being used to further the Trust’s goals.

The Trust board are currently looking at options for extending and improving the 50/50 draw and would love to hear from anyone who can help improve what we do.
  
Please contact the Trust via <info@robinstrust.org> if you can help sell tickets, or have ideas to share.

And remember to buy more than one ticket for the final draw of the season when there is our biggest ever prize to be won.
