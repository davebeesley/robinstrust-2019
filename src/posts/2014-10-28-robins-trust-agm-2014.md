The Robins Trust will be holding their 2014 Annual General Meeting on Thursday 6th November at 19:00.

The AGM will be held in the Victory Lounge at Whaddon Road and will last around 30 minutes. Â This will be followed by a Fan&#8217;s Forum with Paul Baker and Mark Yates.

Robins Trust members are invited and encouraged to attend the AGM but all supporters are welcome to attend the Fan&#8217;s Forum.

There will be some exciting Trust news at the AGM but if you can&#8217;t make it then don&#8217;t worry as the minutes from the AGM will be published online after the event.
