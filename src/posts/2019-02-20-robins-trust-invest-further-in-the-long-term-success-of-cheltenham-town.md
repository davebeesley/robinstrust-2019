A new £8,000 investment has strengthened the Robins Trust’s stake in Cheltenham Town Football Club.

The latest investment means the Trust now holds close to 190,000 shares and holds the fourth largest stake in the club.

It now means that over the past 14 years £284,644 has been invested in the club on behalf of the supporters.

Robins Trust Fan Elected Director Dave Beesley said that the current investment came after a request from the club at a board meeting.

“After receiving the request from the club, we had a discussion among the Trust board about whether the Trust was able to invest,” he said.

“We have a duty in our constitution to maintain prudent reserves – a rainy day fund if you will – but the unanimous feeling of the board was that to make an £8,000 investment.

“This investment was made possible by the fantastic support of our members and match day draw punters.

&#8220;The Trust would love to continue making investments like this as part of its commitment to the long term success of the club.

&#8220;The more members, and participants in our various events and the match day draw, the bigger our future investments can be.”

While in the past the Trust have earmarked special projects for investment or invested on the proviso that money is spent on certain things, this policy will change.

After receiving advice from Supporters Direct – the umbrella organisation for Supporters Trusts – the Trust will write to the club to outline a change in policy.

Trust chairman James Young explained: “Dave and I were tasked by the Trust board to speak with Supporters Direct and ask their advice on the best way for the Trust to operate.

“After those discussions and advice from Supporters Direct a proposal was made to the Trust board to make a change.

“Supporters Direct have advised us to have a more formal relationship with the Club and the only proviso on this investment is that we hold meetings to explore that new relationship.

“We want to be a friend and supporter of the Club, but we are also duty-bound to represent our members and all Robins fans’ interests, to be a critical friend.

“I have written to the club explaining this proposed new relationship and look forward to meeting with them soon.”
