The Robins Trust will be holding a special &#8216;Blue Christmas&#8217; Fans Fest before this weekend&#8217;s game against Crewe Alexandra at the LCI Rail Stadium.\*\*

It&#8217;s all part of the effort by ourselves and [the club to turn blue][1] for the first time ever and raise awareness of the work done by the British Lung Foundation.

And because it&#8217;s the final match before Christmas we are inviting the legendary [DJ Shippers][2] (above) to play a set to kickstart the day in perfect style.

The resident Lakefest DJ and Whaddon Road regular will be building up the atmosphere and getting everyone into the spirit of things before kick-off.

He will be joined by our special guest DJs Jordon &#8216;Fozzy&#8217; Forster and Jordan &#8216;Cranners&#8217; Cranston, playing their part in the occasion with a few selections of their own!

As usual the bar will open at midday and DJ Shippers will get underway around 12.30pm, while the players will join the party by 2pm.

Entry is free, but there will be a bucket for the British Lung Foundation and we encourage supporters to make a small donation if they&#8217;re able to do so.

Please note the capacity is limited so we would also urge fans to arrive as early as possible to guarantee entry.

The side bar will be open for supporters who want to enjoy a pint in more peaceful surroundings, and there will also be [another opportunity to join the Trust for £5][3].

- **The Robins Trust&#8217;s Dave Jennings and Jordon Forster will be the studio guests for [_Footy Thursday_][4] on BBC Radio Gloucestershire this week, discussing Saturday&#8217;s charity event so tune in between 6pm and 7pm for the weekly football show.**
