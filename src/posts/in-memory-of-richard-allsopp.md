The Robins Trust board were stunned and saddened to learn that our friend and colleague Richard Allsopp has passed away.

One of our hardiest and hardest-working volunteers, Rich was our raffle and events organiser.\
\
Whatever the weather, he would be out and about on a matchday selling 1/100 draw tickets, always with a smile on his face.\
\
Never slow to come up with an idea or comment on Trust matters, Rich was a valued and liked member of the small Trust board. We will all miss him.

Trust chair James Young said: "Prior to joining the Trust board, Rich was one of those many Robins fans that you knew, recognised and chatted to without ever really getting to know properly.\
\
"Happily, that changed when he became a member of the Trust board and, as a group, Rich became our good friend and we all got to understand the passion he had for his home town club.\
\
"He was never shy of volunteering for the difficult jobs, like selling raffle tickets, becoming our lottery agent and organising many of the Trust's events.\
\
"We will miss his enthusiasm, his passion for helping the club and his always lively contributions to Trust meetings.\
\
"But most of all, on a personal level, I'll miss having those quick chats about a bad referee, the player who isn't performing or how bad the opposition are.\
\
"As a Trust board, we will look for a way to properly commemorate Rich and ensure that the work he did to help and support his club is rightly and properly remembered."
