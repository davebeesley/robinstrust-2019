**The next step in the reorganisation of the Robins Trust will take place on Monday night.**

Following the election of Murry Toms as Fan Elected Director and Clive Gowing&#8217;s decision to stand down as chairman, the Trust has been planning for changes.

An open meeting last month was attended by nearly 50 fans, many of whom registered an interest in becoming a Trust board member.

On Monday night (7.30pm) the Trust will hold a board meeting in the main bar at Whaddon Road and any fan who is interested in helping the Trust going forward is welcome to attend.

This meeting will start plotting a course for what the Trust does next as well as starting the restructuring of the Trust board.

Trust FED Murry Toms said: &#8220;The Trust will be changing in the coming weeks and months and this is your chance to be involved in that change.

&#8220;The existing board have done an outstanding job over the past decade, achieving some magnificent things.

&#8220;The key to building on that is to have a new board of Robins fans who want to do their bit going forward.

&#8220;This meeting is open to any Robins fan who wants to help and I would urge any supporter who can help comes to the meeting to help plot a course for an exciting future.&#8221;
