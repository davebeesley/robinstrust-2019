In advance of the 2015 Robins Trust AGM, the agenda and Draft Accounts (for 2014-2015) are available online.

The accounts are currently under independent audit (as required by Trust rules) and this should be complete within the next few days.  No changes to the Draft accounts are expected.  The audited accounts will be uploaded as soon as they are available.
