The annual meeting of Cheltenham Town Supporters Society Ltd - the Robins Trust - will take place on Monday, November 30.

Due to the pandemic, the meeting will take place via Zoom video conferencing, with details to be supplied in due course.

Football supporters everywhere are more than aware of the impact of Covid-19 on the game around the globe.

The restrictions on supporters, uncertainty for players, loss of revenue for clubs and disruption of play spanning two seasons has devastated our football community in more than just financial terms.

The hardship will be felt by all clubs as a result of this unfortunate global crisis.

At The Robins Trust, we feel there is an opportunity to be seized for supporters to come together and Protect our Robins.

Our aim is to continue to invest in The Club and help to secure what is valued in our football loving community.

We hope that our members will be actively involved in this years AGM and Board and FED election process.

There are up to 15 vacancies on the Robins Trust Board, so please consider joining and playing your part, especially at this crucial time.

Everyone has something to offer. We hope the football community will come together to join us as we work towards raising the profile of The Robins Trust, increasing membership and supporting our exciting up and coming initiatives to Protect our Robins

Be more than a spectator

Have a voice, make a difference

and help to invest in the future of Cheltenham Town Football Club, our club.
