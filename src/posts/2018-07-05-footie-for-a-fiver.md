The Robins Trust is delighted to announce that we have linked up with Bishop’s Cleeve Football Club with a special offer exclusive to Trust members.

Trust members will be able to gain adult admission to Mitres’ home games for just £5 on Saturdays when the Robins aren’t at home.

The offer, which will see under-16s go free if accompanied by an adult, is also valid for midweek games when there is no fixture clash with games at the Jonny-Rocks Stadium.

Cleeve are looking to bounce back into the Southern League during the coming season and Trust chairman Dave Jennings said the deal will hopefully be a winner for all.

“We would never want to discourage fans from travelling across the country to watch the Robins, but the reality is that for a lot of us, that is impossible for one reason or another,” Jennings said.

“When the Robins aren’t at home we struggle to get our football fix, but hopefully this offer will change that – with a bonus of supporting a local club who we all regard as our second team.

“We’re thrilled that the Cleeve committee and manager Steve Cleal were open to the idea and want to wish them all the best with their bounceback campaign – let’s hope you follow the Robins’ lead.”

Entrance to Hellenic League matches at Kayte Lane costs £8 for adults, so the saving for Trust members is significant, especially when it costs just £5 for a season-long Trust membership.

To qualify for the special rate you must show your Trust membership card at the Kate Lane turnstiles &#8211; with under-16s let in for free alongside a paying adult.

Cleeve boss Steve Cleal added:“ I am hoping that the Robins Rrust members get themselves down to The Lane asoften as possible this year when Cheltenham aren’t playing or away.

“We will welcome all the support in what should be a good season with our bounceback campaign.

“When I met up with Dave to discuss this idea and others it was a no brainer and hopefully be a partnership that we can build on in the future.”
