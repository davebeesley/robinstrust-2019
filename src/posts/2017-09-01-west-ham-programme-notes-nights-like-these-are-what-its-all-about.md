**The Robins Trust provides some thoughts for the club&#8217;s matchday programme for each home game – here&#8217;s what we said for the West ham United edition:**

Nights like these are what it’s all about. You quickly forget the 4am finishes, the motorway standstills, dreadful service station sandwiches, grotty hotels and last minute defeats when West Ham United and the TV cameras roll into town. What a fantastic occasion it promises to be and another one to add to the memory bank.

There has been just 16 days since we were paired with the eastenders and tonight’s match, leaving the club little time to pull together a plan. The Trust were represented in the initial meeting the day after the draw to advise on pricing and priority but the club got it spot on both counts.

Having a say in these discussions is so important and a major reason for being part of the Trust. It’s a direct line into the meeting and I can assure you, the club take note. We’ve seen dozens of new sign ups in recent days, each of which guaranteed their match ticket by joining. It’s another of the Trust’s key selling points following an agreement between the Trust and the club back in the day.

We offered help in terms of bodies to help ease the pressure on club staff over the week, but in the end they weren’t required. Credit to Luke James, the club’s ticket office manager. It’s no mean feat to service the demand but together with a handful of regular volunteers, his operation ran smoothly. Well done all.

It’s great to welcome back those supporters that don’t come as often as the rest of us. These evenings are so important if the club are going to grow its regular attendances over the season. Making our big games better is key to attracting people back to Whaddon Road and we look forward to seeing you all again soon.

For the diehard fans this is reward for all the time, effort and money invested into the cause. We’ve had some big ones down the years against Fulham, Sunderland, Tottenham, Everton, Newcastle and of course West Ham United but we’ve never nicked a result, losing them 15-3 on aggregate.

A famous cup win would be the coup de gras to mark the 20-year anniversary of our Wembley win. And hopefully we&#8217;ll see a few of you back for the important match against Exeter City on Saturday.
