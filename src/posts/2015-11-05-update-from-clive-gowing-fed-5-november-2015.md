  <span class="s1">Dear Robins Trust Member</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It has been a couple of months since I last got in contact and I would like to update you on the various things I have been doing in my role as Fan Elected Director.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Forest Green Rovers home match</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">You may have read in Paul Baker’s programme notes for the Havant and Waterlooville game that the board made the decision to turn down the opportunity to have the Forest Green match televised.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This decision was made collectively by the board of directors.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We felt that it wasn’t right to move the game to a Thursday night as it is one that is capturing the imagination of the supporters. I know it was the first game I looked for when the fixtures were released.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We felt that moving the match would have an impact on the attendance and we wanted to give as many supporters as possible the chance to attend the match and enjoy a fantastic atmosphere.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It meant that we turned down £7,000 from BTSport – something that may have proved useful in the January transfer window – but as a board we need to make sure that short-term financial gains are not made at the expense of supporters.</span>
</p>

  <span class="s1"><b>FA Cup Ticket Prices</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The FA Cup is a competition that has always been very important, not least through the great memories created in games against Burnley, West Brom, Newcastle, Spurs and Everton.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I know there were some comments about the prices for the Havant and Waterlooville replay.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The rules of the Cup mean that the ticket prices for the initial match and any replay are set prior to the first fixture.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The prices were set with Havant as they have been with Hartlepool for the first round tie although there is no requirement to have the same prices for each leg (i.e a different price can be charged for the first game vs a replay). If the Hartlepool match does result in a replay then the board have looked to set these prices to be attractive and affordable and gives the team the best chance of progression to the next round.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ticket prices are set round by round and should we continue to progress in the Cup, then prices may increase, in line with our normal matchday prices, or even above that level.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As Fan Elected Director, I will be involved in those decisions and will report back to you as and when any decisions are made to explain.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Focus Groups</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">During the Focus Group held in the summer it was agreed to meet again after six-months to report on progress and to raise any other issues.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Rather than hold the next group in December – a month that is always busy for us all – we will look to hold the next one sometime in January.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I will be in touch nearer the date to let you know where and when the next Focus Group will be held and how you can be involved.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Robins Trust AGM  and Fans Forum</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Robins Trust AGM will be on Thursday, November 12 at 7pm. The meeting will be followed by a fans forum with Gary Johnson.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Unfortunately Paul Baker is unable to attend this event and sends his apologies. This is always an evening that Paul tries to attend and is the first one he will miss in the 10 years the trust have been going. I will however be on hand to field any questions directly to the CTFC board during the fans forum.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I hope as many of you as possible will attend to learn more about the Trust, ask our board questions or to hear from Gary.</span>
