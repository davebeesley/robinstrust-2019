It now costs <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>just £5</strong></span> to help shape the future of the Robins Trust and our Football Club.

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">Our agenda is simple:</span>**

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">The more members we have – the louder our voice can be</span>**

Cheltenham Town Football Club is going through a period of change for the first time in more than two decades.

With long-standing chairman Paul Baker standing down at the end of the season after 21 success-filled years, there is not only a new chairman but a new role for the Robins Trust.

The Trust holds the largest number of shares on the current club board, but that’s not enough. We want our mandate to be bigger and bolder than ever before.

Our FED will always call the club to account when needed – putting the fans first.

But our voice is only as loud as the number of members we have in our corner.

And that’s where you come in…

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">HOW TO JOIN</span>**

At our AGM last year, Trust members voted in a proposal to make membership more affordable than ever before, slashing yearly subscription costs from £12 to £5.

Trust membership now also runs alongside the football season – officially running through to May 31 for all members.

All annual subscription membership accounts therefore expired last month and all yearly members will need to re-subscribe.

Visit [Join the Trust][1] to pay either by credit or debit card (with no administration fee) or by Pay-Pal, or to find out how to pay by cash, cheque or bank transfer/standing order

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">EXISTING 10, 25 or LIFE MEMBERS</span>**

Please e-mail <members@robinstrust.org> with your preferred contact e-mail address or telephone number, so we can comply with the new GDPR legislation.

Your continued support will help the Trust have a stronger, louder voice on club matters and help drive the club forward in a new era under a new chairman.

A strong Trust will make our club stronger.
