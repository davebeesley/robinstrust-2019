We have been discussing with local businesses the opportunity they have by becoming a Robins Trust Partner, offering preferential deals, offers and discounts to Trust Members.

Over the next few weeks we will be announcing our Partners and the benefits they will offer. Currently we have negotiated deals with local businesses such as Pubs, Restaurants & DIY Outlets.

If you are a local business or have a service to offer and you are interested in becoming a Trust Partner we would be delighted to hear from you.

Those who recently attended the Trust AGM will have seen our commitment to not only representing the interests of our supporters, but also the interests of the wider community in which we live and work.

The safety and comfort of our fans is paramount but we will also be in conversation with the local community understanding the impact of the Football Club and how we as a Trust can develop Social Value initiatives.

We are here to be your Voice at the Club, a point of contact for your concerns and issues. As a Trust Board we will take it upon ourselves to encourage full inclusivity in how we support our club, developing initiatives to widen our support base across our whole community.

We have recently worked with the club to introduce the Robins Trust Speedy Skips Half Time Challenge. Our Trust Members, Jack O&#8217;Neill and James Robinson took part in the first event which will give our fans the opportunity to demonstrate their own football talents while raising funds for Sue Ryder charities.

Speedy Skips have kindly offered to donate Â£100 for every ball that lands in the skip! We would like to hear from you if you would like to take part in future Half Time Challenges.
