**Last night our online auction of match worn shirts drew to a close with supporters vying for a piece of Cheltenham Town history.**

It saw a flurry of late bidding which took the total raised through [AMS Auctions][1] alone to almost £2,800.

Harry Pell&#8217;s shirt topped the lot, going for a staggering £503 with all but two of the blue jerseys going for more than £100.

The money raised last night will be added to the proceeds of the bucket collection and auctions at the ground immediately after the match on December 9.

In the end, going blue for Crewe raised **£5,145.33** for the [British Lung Foundation][2].

It was an initiative by the fans to put on a show of togetherness with Vicky Veness and Ian Hutton, while raising funds and awareness for the UK&#8217;s only charity that looks after the nation&#8217;s lungs.

With the event gaining local and national attention in the media, including an appearance on Sky Sports&#8217; Soccer AM, we achieved everything we set out to do.

A shirt signed by studio guests Tyson Fury, Danny Dyer and Jimmy Bullard in itself fetched £152.

We have invited the charity back to the LCI Rail Stadium in the next few weeks so that the supporters can hand over the big cheque at half-time. We&#8217;ll release the details of that as soon as we have it.

And the best news of the lot is that [Vicky recently received some fantastic news][3], reporting she was in remission after treatment.

Thank you to every single volunteer, supporter, player and member of staff at the club for their contribution. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without you.

**Won a shirt?**

Winning bidders will need to collect their shirts from AMS Auctions, based in Leckhampton from tomorrow.
