**Preparations are already underway ahead of this year&#8217;s open day.**

The popular event is open for all supporters to meet the management, players and staff in July ahead of the new season.

A number of new ideas were suggested at the recent [open board meeting][1] and we will be hosting a planning meeting on **Tuesday 30 May (7.30pm)** in the main bar at the LCI Rail Stadium.

Everyone is welcome to join us and play a part in putting it on.

If you think you can contribute, no matter how small, please let us know at robinstrust@outlook.com or tweet us [@robinstrust][2].
