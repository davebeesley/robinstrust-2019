  <span class="s1">Dear Robins Trust Member</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There has been lots to update you on since I last wrote to you.  As part of my commitment to you as the Trust&#8217;s fan-elected director, I wanted to let you know what has been happening.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Board Meetings</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I have attended two full board meetings in the last month, both of which have seen some tough decisions made, but I hope you feel, as I do, that positives steps are now being taken by the Club.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The meetings have been very much focused on the season ahead and ways to ensure that the club has the best possible chance to bounce back into the Football League at the first attempt.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The welcome I have received from all of the board members has been terrific, to a man they have all welcomed me as the Trust representative and I am confident that we can all work well together both now and in the future.</span>
</p>

  <span class="s1"><b>Sub Committees</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The Robins Trust board have also met and agreed on who will sit on each of the three sub committees of the Football Club board.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The three committee members are:</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Clive Gowing – Finance Sub Committee</span>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><b>Focus Groups</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The focus group was held at Whaddon Road earlier in May, there was a terrific turnout of supporters and a huge amount of ideas were raised and discussed.</span>
</p>

<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The feedback from that night is currently being put together and I will send out an update on the next steps we can take following the focus groups in the next few weeks.</span>
</p>

<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">I will also be presenting all the suggestions to the Football Club board and discuss how we can best ensure that the suggestions and ideas raised are acted upon.</span>
</p>

<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> </span><span class="s1">I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who attended, or provided feedback in advance of the event.</span>
</p>

<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The Trust and Club hope to be able to organise further regular focus groups, with another session to be planned before the end of the current year.</span>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Steve Smith and the 500 club are undertaking the worthwhile task of giving the main bar at Whaddon Road a complete overhaul this summer.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Steve is looking for volunteers to help strip the wallpaper off the walls on Saturday, May 30</span><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> and Sunday, May 31 for a few hours each morning.</span>

  <span class="s1"><b>Cricket Festival</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If you need a sporting fix during the summer, the Football Club have a marquee at the Cheltenham Cricket Festival on the first day of the Festival on Wednesday, July 8.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tickets, which include morning coffee, lunch and afternoon tea, a pay bar – and hopefully some decent cricket as Gloucestershire face Northamptonshire – are £60 inclusive of VAT.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If there is enough interest them the Trust would like to have one or two Trust tables in the marquee.</span>

  <span class="s1"><b>Robins Trust Membership Packs</b></span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Apologies to any new Robins Trust members for a delay in getting their membership packs.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There has been an issue with the printing of share certificates so there has been a delay in getting the packs in the post.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We hope to get that rectified quickly and have the membership packs sent out as soon as possible.</span>
