**The Robins Trust are delighted to announce that new membership packs are now available for all Trust members.**

Starting on Saturday, packs can be picked up by members from the Trust Surgery in the main club bar.

Packs include a welcome letter detailing the relaunch of the Trust, along with a new membership card and share certificate.

Each Trust member holds a non-transferable £1 share in the Trust and existing members will receive a new certificate, but retain their original share number.

The new membership packs have been introduced to coincide with a new era for the Trust and they will show the new branding voted for by members in October.

Trust chairman Tarran Wilson said: &#8220;With the organisation getting a fresh new look and almost entirely new board, we though about updating what we give back to our members.

&#8220;The new packs show our new logo and branding as we embark on an exciting new era for the Trust in the coming year.

&#8220;Where possible, to save money and reduce our environmental impact, we would encourage fans to collect their packs from our surgery desk on a matchday.

Members who are unable to get to the matchday surgery, can request to have their pack delivered to a collection point in either the Colin Farmer Stand or (behind the goal) stand.

Any expat members who need their pack mailee are asked to contact the Trust to arrange postage.

In both instances, members are asked to email info@robinstrust.org.

&#8220;The Trust has always relied on volunteers and the complexities of having a year-round renewal process has made the task of stating up-to-date increasingly difficult.

&#8220;But with members voting to change our membership prices and structure at our most recent AGM, we believe those issues are a thing of the past.&#8221;

At the Trust&#8217;s October AGM, members voted unanimously to reduce membership subscriptions to £5 and standardise the membership year to June-May from 2017 onwards.

Full details of the renewal process for all single year members will be communicated to members in April.

However, if you are a member who has never received an email from us, please contact us to ensure your details are current and correct.
