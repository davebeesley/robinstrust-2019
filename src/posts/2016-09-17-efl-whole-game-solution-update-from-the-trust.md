Following on from the open letter to all Robins Trust Members and Supporters of Cheltenham Town the Robins Trust would like to explain their current thoughts with regards The Whole Game Solution.

Many supporters will have read or seen some of the headline behind the recent football league proposals not least the proposal for an additional 8 teams to be included within the football league to form 5 divisions of 20 teams.

We are told by the EFL that the driver behind these proposals are to solve fixture congestion and improve the national team. Whilst every English football fan will agree that the national team needs improving we can’t see what positive impact league two matches will have on the English national team. The Premier League already has a league of 20 and although the Championship has a league of 24 teams none of the most recent England squads included players from the Championship.

The second issue that we are told needs resolving is that of fixture congestion and the clashes with the Champions League. Clashes with Champions League football does have an effect on attendances, however improved planning around midweek fixture should be able to resolve this given the fact that the current league two fixture list currently only has 6 Tuesday night matches scheduled.

The current proposals offer far too much contradiction, the above paragraph is designed to reduce the amount of mid week matches in an order to increase attendances. However the proposals then offers the suggestion to consider the FA Cup becoming a mid week completion whilst keeping the tradition and prestige of the competition and the idea of a winter break.

As supporters of league two clubs we would not be against the idea of a winter break in the Premier League and even the Championship but lets use this to the advantage of league one, league two and the non league pyramid. Lets use a winter break in the top two league in the country to promote football at a lower level and use this as a time to show case football to the thousands of supporters that believe there is not a life outside the premier league.

Finally we lead onto the financial implications of the proposals. Each club in league two will be playing four less home games resulting in a reduction in matchday revenue and the current football league and premier league solidarity payments will now be split over an extra eight teams. How this loss in revenue will be covered is still yet to be explained within the proposals or indeed how the current split between football league or solidarity payments following the new league structure.

Far too many of the current proposals are unknown or contradict themselves. A proposal on how the additional eight teams will be made up has still to be determined (apart from knowing that 2 teams will not be relegated for one season the criteria for the other six has yet to be decided).

The Robins Trust can assure fans that there voice will be heard on these proposals and are planning to use our AGM due by the end of November to discuss these proposals. . It is hoped that by this time more information may be known following a league meeting of all EFL clubs on September 22<sup>nd</sup> and the Robins Trust are also planning to attend a meeting of all EFL supporters Trusts regarding this subject to be held in October.

If you would like to contact the Robins Trust on this subject or any other matter please feel free to speak to any raffle seller on a match day or email <info@robinstrust.org>
