We are delighted to publish the agenda for our 2018 Annual General Meeting to be held on October 18 at the Jonny-Rocks Stadium.

At the meeting we will give you an update on an eventful year for the Trust, receive our accounts for the past 12 months and ratify our recent election process.

We recently confirmed that due to the number of available places on the board being greater than the number of applications that there would be no formal election at the AGM.
  
Therefore, Dave Beesley, Leo Hoenig and Nathan Mattick were duly elected to serve for another two-year term on the Trust board.

Following the business part of the evening, we are thrilled to announce that Cheltenham Town manager Michael Duff and members of the Club Board will be attending an open forum.
  
This is the first chance for fans to meet and chat to the new manager and we hope this will prove to be a valuable exercise in bringing the club and fans closer.
  
The meeting and forum is open to both Trust members and non-members, although only Trust members will be allowed to speak during the formal business of the evening prior to the forum.
