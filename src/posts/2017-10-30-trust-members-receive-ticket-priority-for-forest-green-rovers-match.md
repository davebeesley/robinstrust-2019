**Robins Trust members will receive ticket priority for November&#8217;s historic first Football League Gloucestershire derby.**

November&#8217;s &#8216;El Glosico&#8217; clash with Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn will see a large travelling contingent of Robins heading to Nailsworth.

With tickets likely to be in high demand, the Trust have, once again, secured ticket priority, ahead of general sale tickets.

Tickets will go on sale to season ticket holders, club staff and away travel club members on October 31 through to November 7.

Robins Trust members will then have a priority window running between Thursday, November 9 and kick off in the League Two home match with Luton Town on November 11.

Trust chairman Tarran Wilson said: &#8220;Once again, Trust fan elected director Murry Toms acted quickly to secure this benefit for Trust members.

&#8220;While season ticket holders and regular away supporters are, of course, deserving of advance priority, it&#8217;s great that Trust members are given this added benefit.

&#8220;[T][1][rust membership is now just £5][1] for adult members and we already have guaranteed ticket priority for any future big Cup ties for all members.

&#8220;We are all looking forward to the first Gloucestershire Football League derby and I&#8217;m sure that tickets will sell out in the away end.

&#8220;Anyone who wants to **[join the Trust can do so on our website www.robinstrust.org][1] **or by visiting our new Trust Surgery on home match days in the main bar.&#8221;

You must be signed up as a Robins Trust member by Wednesday, November 8 (11.59pm) to be eligible for second tier priority ticketing.
