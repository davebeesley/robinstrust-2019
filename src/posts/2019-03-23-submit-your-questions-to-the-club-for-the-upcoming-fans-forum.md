This week, the Football Club are holding their annual shareholders meeting and fans forum and the Trust will be in attendance.

Through the Trust, the fans are the fourth largest shareholder in Cheltenham Town and we always want to ensure views of the average fan are heard by the board.

We have our Fan Elected Director as a conduit to that happening every day, but events like the shareholders meeting offer another chance for Trust members to have their say.

All attendees are welcome to ask questions, however questions from shareholders will be invited first, and all Trust members are shareholders in our Club.

So, Trust chairman James Young will be attending the meeting as the Trust&#8217;s formal representative and will ask any questions put forward by Trust members.

Only questions put forward by existing, full Trust members can be asked. But please use this chance to air any praise, questions or criticism you may have, so we can help build a better club.
