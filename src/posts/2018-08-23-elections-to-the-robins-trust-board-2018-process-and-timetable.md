<span style="font-weight: 400;">The election will follow the following process:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trust board currently has 11 members. Trust rules say that the board will consist of no fewer than 6 and no more than 16 members.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The election will be run by an Election Management Group consisting of one member of the Trust board (who is not standing for re-election) and an independent scrutineer.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">James Young (Robins Trust) was chosen to organise the election as per a Board Meeting on Monday, July 16 2018. After consultation with Supporters Direct, Neil Le Milliere (Exeter City Supporters Trust has agreed to be the independent scrutineer).</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Trust Board meeting on July 16, 2018 a drawing of lots was held to decide which of the 11 current board members – elected at the 2017 AGM – will be standing down. As the entire board was elected at the Trust relaunch in 2012, it was necessary for half of the board to stand down.  It was decided to choose six members at random, with two exceptions, listed in point five. For the avoidance of any doubt all existing board members are entitled to stand for re-election if they wish. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">As Trust chairman Dave Jennings and Fan Elected Director Dave Beesley had been elected into their posts since the last AGM, it was agreed they should stand. Lots were drawn for the remaining four positions at random.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">As per Trust rules, anyone standing for election shall be a fully paid member of the society, and be nominated by two other full society members.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nominees will also be asked to supply a statement supporting their nomination as per rule 6 of the Trust Election Policy.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">As per rule 5 of the Trust Election Policy, it is the candidate’s responsibility to ensure their candidacy is valid as per the terms above.</span>
</li>
