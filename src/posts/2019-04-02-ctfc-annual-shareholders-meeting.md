The Football Club held its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, March 27th. As is traditional, this was followed by a fans’ forum.

The Robins Trust is the fourth largest shareholder in the Football Club, and was represented.

The Chairman of the Trust, James Young put forward questions that were submitted by Trust members.

Our Fan Elected Director was present along with other members of the Club Board to answer questions from shareholders.
