**The Robins Trust will be opening the doors of Cheltenham Town’s Seasons Training Ground for an interactive open day on Sunday, July 16.
  
** 
  
As in years gone by, the Open Day will see the launch of a new kit – with the new change colours on view for the first time.

Gary Johnson and his staff will also conduct an open training session with the first team players.

This year, for the first time Graham Fletcher and the Cup-winning Cheltenham Town Ladies team will be training at the same time as their male contemporaries.And the football action doesn’t stop there.

As part of the outstanding Crowdfunder campaign to install the new Whaddon Road scoreboard, fans paid for the chance to play against Robins legends.

The Trust are delighted to confirm that the Legends match (or matches as the demand for a slice of the action meant nearly 40 fans signing up) will take place at the Open Day.

John Finnigan, Jerry Gill, Shane Duff, Richard Walker and Tony Naylor are all already confirmed as taking part, with many more Robins greats expected to join the throng.

**[Open Day 2017: download the poster][1]**

The Open Day will kick-off at midday when the first team get to work for their daily training session before attention turns to the Ladies for a training session of their own at 12.30pm.

Having been put through their paces by Gary Johnson, the Robins will then take on… the Robins with the squad going head to head in 7v7 matches.

The new change kit will be launched at 1.30pm, after which you will have the chance to get your ‘Chelfies’ with the squad, pick up those autographs and join Harry Pell on the bouncy castle.

As well as having the first chance to buy new kit, supporters will be able to collect their season tickets ahead of the big League Two kick-off on August 5.

And the day will conclude with the long-awaited fans v legends matches at 2.30pm.

Trust acting chairman Tarran Wilson said: “The Robins Trust takes great pride in organising and arranging the Open Day each year.

“As well as all the entertainment on offer, it’s a great chance for all Robins fans to mingle, chat to the players and staff.

“With the title-winning Ladies team and a host of Robins legends getting involved this year, it will hopefully be the best one yet.”

To help with the entertainment on the day, the Trust would like to hear from any businesses in the area who would like to help run this outstanding community event.

If you have an ice cream van, run a face painting business or hire bouncy castles we want to hear from you.
