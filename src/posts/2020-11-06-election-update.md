The Robins Trust is thrilled to welcome three new members to its board following the conclusion of its election process.

We are also pleased to announce that **Dave Beesley** was elected unopposed to serve a second two-year term as the Trust’s **Fan Elected Director**.

In the board elections, **Jenny Hancock**, **Jaimie Henderson** and **David Le Borgeois** submitted successful applications in line with the election process ahead of the November 6 deadline.

Re-standing board members **Dave Beesley**, **James Young**, **John Cooper** and **Nathan Mattick** also submitted successful applications.

As the number of board members doesn’t exceed the maximum permitted in the Trust’s rules of 16, all seven members join **Leo Hoenig** – who ran this year’s election – in being elected to the board.

Both elections will be subject to formal ratification by Trust members at this year’s AGM, to be held on November 30.

The Trust Board would like to thank **Neil Le Milliere** for his hard work and diligence in overseeing and scrutineering this year’s elections in line with the Trust’s rules.

The board would also like to thank **Graham Fletcher**, who decided not to stand for re-election, for his work during his time on the board.

The Trust is always open to members joining the board and holds the rights, within its rules, to co-opt two more directors outside of the election period.

Anyone interested in joining the board can contact [info@robinstrust.org](mailto:info@robinstrust.org) or contact the Trust via the form on [www.robinstrust.org](https://www.robinstrust.org)

With the election process concluded, save for ratification, the new Trust board aims to get to work immediately on a fund-raising campaign to help our club through the coronavirus pandemic.
